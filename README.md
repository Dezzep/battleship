Goals Of This Project:

1. Enforce descriptive README
2. Test Driven Development => 
      . test Query Inputs + Command Inputs
      . test outgoing commands if they cause mutations
3. BattleShip Ai that does not strictly use math.random 
      . If it hits the ship it should keep trying to hit surrounding areas untill the ship has sunk
      . Maybe it can shoot in checkerboard style patterns or diagonal patters.
